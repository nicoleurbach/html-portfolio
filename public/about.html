<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I've lived many lives. And it seems that I will continue to do so. I'm a voracious learner, and when I find something that interests me, I want to learn as much as I can about it and continue to improve my skills. Usually, the things that interest me will help the organizations I work with. When I see a problem, I am compelled to figure out how to solve it. </p>

<p>Not only my workplace, but my friends and family also appreciate my appetite for knowledge, skills, and expertise. Most of them are very similar. When we put our heads together, there's nothing we can't figure out.</p>

<p>This world we live in needs some help. And that's okay because there are plenty of us who want to figure out how to support change and the ways in which we need to learn and grow to make it happen. It's a wonderful time to be alive. </p>
